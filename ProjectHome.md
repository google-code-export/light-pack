The software analyses the image on your monitor and transfers its data by USB to the Ligthpack board. This board lights the surface behind a monitor, TV or laptop by means of RGB LEDs of the corresponded colors. The effect reminds the illumination of Phillips Ambilight TVs most of all.

In the project Wiki you will find the [operation principal description](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/wiki/Basics), the [device assembly instructions](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/wiki/LightpackDIY) (not up to date) and the [software description](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/wiki/SettingsDescription). Besides that, [PCB files](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/downloads/detail?name=Lightpack%20PCB%206.0L.zip) in Eagle CAD format, device [firmware](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/downloads/detail?name=Firmware_6.2.hex) and [software](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/downloads/detail?name=PrismatikSetup_5.9.6.exe) for image capture are stored in [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/light-pack/downloads/list). You can find all operational details and news in [our blog](http://pixelkit.ru/) (in Russian). Also you can find [more pics](https://picasaweb.google.com/108808791782514191974/GevkHC) in Picasa album and [more demos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFB8EF1FECE235B4C) in YouTube playlist.
